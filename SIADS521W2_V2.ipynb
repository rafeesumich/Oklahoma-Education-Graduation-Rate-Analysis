    "#### <b>Overview of the analysis:</b>\n",
    "This work is a study of Okalahoma state graduation rates by ethnic groups in the year 2017.\n",
    "You can get the yearly graduation Rate data from Oklahome state education department webside.\n",
    "Here is the link: https://sde.ok.gov/sde/sites/ok.gov.sde/files/documents/files/2017%20Graduation%20Rate.xlsx\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dataset:</b>\n",
    "This dataset contains graduation rates at three levels.\n",
    "1. Overall state level graduation rate\n",
    "2. School level graduation rate, that give graduation rate at HighSchoo level.\n",
    "3. District level graduation rate, that gives graduation rate from PK to 9th grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Procedure:</b>\n",
    "1. Prepare the dataset: Split the data into three datasets, \n",
    "    <br>i. State level\n",
    "    <br>ii. Highschool level, grades 9 to 12th\n",
    "    <br>iii. District level, grades PK to 8th.\n",
    "2. Exploratory Data Analysis:\n",
    "    <br>i. State level graduation rate analysis, this data is studied at Ethnicity level, and identify the most and least performing groups at state level.\n",
    "    <br>ii. Study the Highschool level graduation rates, identify wich groups are performing least and most.\n",
    "    <br>iii. Study of District level graduation rates, how each ethnic group is performing, see if the same graduation rates are carried over to Highschool and State level rates.\n"

    "### Visualization Technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to use mainly three visualization techniques for this study:\n",
    "1. <b>Box plots</b>:\n",
    "    Box plots are good starting point for univariot numerical analysis, \n",
    "    Which mean it analyzes single set of data. \n",
    "    It summerizes this data into Quartiles: Q1(25%), Q2(50%) and Q3(75%). \n",
    "    And show us inter quartail ranges (IQR) in a box,  out liers will also be shown. If needed it can also show us mean as well.\n",
    "    When to use it: To get a quick summary of single variable.\n",
    "    Limitions: Box plots cant show distribution of data within a single dataset, Conside violin plot for more detailed study of univariate analysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. <b>Violin plots</b>:\n",
    "   Violin plots are best to analyze single variate numerical data. Violin plots can show us distribution of underlying dataset through kernal density function. The distribution can help us identify different categories of data within a single variable. Violin plots will also show us outliers, IQR (Inter Quartile Range). And mean when needed. \n",
    "    each side of the violinplot can be ploted using different categories of data within same dataset.\n",
    "    Limitations: Use a histogram for full univariate analyis. Eventhough Violin plot has Kernal Density fuction builtin, the control ove the visualization is limited. \n",
    "    When to use: To look at the underlying data distribution within a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Histogram</b>:\n",
    "    Histograms are another univaite analysis visualization technique. Histograms are best fit to understand the distribution of data.It divides the variable value range into equally sized bins and calculates the frequence of the variable within each bin. Histograms are great fit for probability distribution of continuous variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other visualization techniques used in this analysis:\n",
    "4. <b>Scatter plot</b>: Good fit for multivariate analysis. We can use this plot to analyse the relationship between multiple variables, can be used to visualize clustering of data within a dataset. \n",
    "5. <b>Bar chart</b> : Use Bar Charts to compare values of diffrent variables\n",
    "6. <b>Maps</b>: Great tool to plot data over a giographical area and compare, similar to heatmap, but data will be ploted on geographical regions. "

It provides abstraction layer on top of matplotlib,It produces attractive and informative statistical graphics, has good integration with <b>pandas</b> library.
